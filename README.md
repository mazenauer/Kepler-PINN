# Kepler-PINN

This repository accompanies a semester thesis on physics-informed neural networks to solve Kepler problems.
The file odeintegrator.py includes a script to solve the IVP with a symplectic Runge-Kutta method to generate a high-fidelity solution.
The file twoBodyPINN.py includes the PINN class and some help functions to train the network and show the progress.

The demo_notebook is meant to reproduce the plots that are featured in the thesis.
